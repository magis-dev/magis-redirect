    <h1>Safety Standards & Reporting</h1>
    <p>Magis is committed to preventing child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) on our platform. Below are our published safety standards and how to report suspected CSAE.</p>

    <h2>Published Safety Standards (in full)</h2>
    <section aria-label="Child sexual abuse and exploitation safety standards">
      <p>Magis maintains the following safety standards to prevent, detect, and respond to child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE):</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Zero-tolerance policy:</strong> Any content or behavior that sexualizes or exploits minors is strictly prohibited. Accounts, profiles, and content that violate this are removed immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Proactive moderation:</strong> We use a mix of automated detection (hash-matching, image/video analysis, metadata checks) and human review to identify potential CSAE content and remove it rapidly.</li>
        <li><strong>User reporting:</strong> We provide clear in-app reporting and this reporting contact for users to report suspected CSAE. Reports are triaged within 24 hours and escalated as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Preservation & escalation:</strong> When CSAE is suspected, we preserve evidence (logs, media, metadata) and, where required by law, promptly notify and cooperate with law enforcement and child protection authorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Account actions:</strong> When an account is found to be involved in CSAE, we will suspend or terminate the account and remove related content. Repeat or severe violations result in permanent bans.</li>
        <li><strong>Data minimization & privacy:</strong> We collect only the information necessary to operate the service and investigations. We store investigative records securely and limit access to authorized personnel.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency & training:</strong> Moderation staff receive regular training on CSAE recognition, evidence handling, and safe reporting. We maintain internal processes for timely takedowns and disclosure to authorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party cooperation:</strong> We cooperate with industry hotlines, NGOs, and law enforcement for rapid reporting and takedown of CSAE material.</li>
        <li><strong>Timelines:</strong> Takedown actions for verified CSAE are performed immediately upon confirmation; initial triage occurs within 24 hours of a report.</li>
      </ol>
